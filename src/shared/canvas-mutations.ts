/**
 * The PUBLISHER's guard: `isCanvasMutation`'s verdict, with a refusal REMEMBERED per node.
 *
 * `isCanvasMutation` answers the size question by serializing the whole node, and a refused node is
 * deliberately re-emitted on every publish (that is what makes the sticky sync the instant the user
 * trims it — see `rebaseRefused` in canvas-publish). A drag publishes at ~20 Hz. So the ONE node that
 * is already pathological — a sticky someone pasted a document into — was being stringified 20 times
 * a second, at a cost proportional to its size, for as long as it stayed oversized. The pathological
 * case must not also be the expensive one.
 *
 * The memo holds the refused node itself and re-checks only when that node's value actually changes
 * (`sameNodeValue`: reference-shallow, so it never touches the big string). Behaviour is unchanged:
 * the same verdict for every input, the refusal is re-paid the moment the node is edited, and the
 * trimmed sticky casts immediately (its entry is dropped as soon as it passes). Bounded by the number
 * of oversized nodes on the canvas — in practice zero or one, and their memory is the node the canvas
 * already holds.
 *
 * The REFLECTOR keeps calling the plain `isCanvasMutation`: its input is untrusted, freshly decoded
 * off the wire for every client, so nothing there would ever hit a memo and the map would grow with
 * whatever ids a client cared to invent. One predicate, one verdict, both ends — this only caches the
 * one end that asks the same question about the same node over and over.
