/**
 * Is one dependency satisfied?
 *
 * `done` is the agent's busy→idle edge — the same signal that drives the completion badge and
 * notification. It means "this station has produced something and stopped", which is exactly
 * when a downstream station should start reading it. It does NOT mean "this station will never
 * run again": an agent that finishes turn 1 and awaits more input is also `done`. That is the
 * intended semantics for a station given one self-contained prompt, and it is documented as
 * such rather than being papered over with a turn counter that would guess differently.
 *
 * A dep that is no longer on the canvas counts as satisfied — a deleted node can never report,
 * so treating it as pending would strand the dependent forever. An UNKNOWN state (the dep
 * exists but has reported nothing yet) is deliberately NOT satisfied: right after a fan-out the
 * upstream stations have not emitted a hook event yet, and reading "no news" as "finished"
 * would fire every dependent immediately — the exact bug that makes a dependency edge useless.
 *
 * A dep that is `done` **with a live `lastTurnError`** is refused (issue #521). An errored station
 * reaches idle IMMEDIATELY and looked healthy from every surface an orchestrator can read, so a
 * whole dependency chain launched against an upstream that had produced nothing. Firing with a
 * warning instead was considered and dropped: a dependent that has already launched cannot
 * un-launch, so the warning would arrive after the damage. The armed node keeps its manual ▶
 * run-now escape, so the human — or the orchestrator, after a retry — is never stuck.
 *
 * The refusal ends by itself: `lastTurnError` is cleared by the upstream's next genuine new turn,
 * so a station that is nudged and answers successfully satisfies its dependents on that turn.

 * setup script with `waitForSetup`: the node's command must not race an `npm ci` that is still
 * writing node_modules underneath it. It answers per group id, and the two gates are ANDed —
 * a node can be waiting on both its upstream stations and its checkout being ready.
 *
 * An ABSENT probe (`setupDone` not passed) means the gate is open. That is the honest default,
 * not laxness: the run store is rebuilt from live events, so after an app restart a node armed
 * with `awaitSetupGroup` has no run to hear from ever again, and reading "nothing known" as
 * "still running" would strand it forever — the same reasoning as a deleted dependency counting
