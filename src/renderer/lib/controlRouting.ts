// WHICH CANVAS answers a canvas-control request — the routing half of the `nodeterm` CLI's
// authorization boundary (Canvas's onAgentControl effect). Pure, so it is unit-testable where the
// React component is not (vitest runs in the node environment); same reasoning as presenceTravel,
// whose project-travel rules this reuses.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS: React Flow only ever holds the ACTIVE project's nodes, but tmux sessions of every
// OTHER open project keep running — they survive an app restart and are re-adopted on boot. Their
// agents still hold NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL and still reach the (rewritten) hook endpoint, so their
// control calls arrive at a canvas that has never heard of the source node. Looking the source up
// in the live canvas alone therefore rejected every agent outside the project the app happened to
// come up on — reported as "source node is not a control-capable agent", which is what a node
// carrying a non-control agent gets, so the failure read as a lost capability rather than as the
// wrong canvas answering. Resolve the OWNING project instead, then answer out of its serialized
// nodes where one of the tiers below allows, and refuse otherwise (`offScreenRefusal`). It is never
// travelled to (Fix #16).
