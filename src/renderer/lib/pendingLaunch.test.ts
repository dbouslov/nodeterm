 * decided a node was ready to launch, not when the node's terminal existed. A cold project switch
 * spends that budget on loading the canvas, mounting the node and spawning tmux, so the launch was
 * abandoned before there was anything to deliver into — and abandoned into a `console.warn`, which
 * left a node reading QUEUED forever with no way to tell it apart from one still waiting on a
 * dependency.
